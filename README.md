Best practice is to create a virtual environment
To create python env:

```
python3 -m venv melanoma-env
source melanoma-env/bin/activate
```

This will open a shell in virtual env

# Dependencies

Make sure you are running python 3.7
Install all deps by:

```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Contributing

Please work on separate branches for each feature (eg. data visualization, data reprocessing, model, GPU optimized model), this will allow us to work on more stuff at once.
